  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the mobile application <strong>vacuactivus_user</strong> (referred to as "the App"). We are committed to protecting children's privacy and complying with all applicable laws and regulations, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The App does <strong>not collect any personal information</strong> such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, or user-generated content directly. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from users under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent.</p>

  <h2>User Authentication</h2>
  <p>The App uses <strong>Firebase Authentication</strong> to allow users to securely sign in using their email address, phone number, or third-party accounts (such as Google, if enabled).</p>
  <p>Firebase Authentication is a service provided by Google LLC. When using this feature, some personal information such as your email address or phone number may be collected and stored by Firebase for the purpose of managing secure login sessions.</p>
  <p>This data is handled according to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase’s Privacy Policy</a> and is not used for advertising or tracking purposes.</p>
  <p>We do not share any user authentication data with third parties and use it only for enabling secure access to the App’s features.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App may use third-party services to ensure functionality and improve user experience. These services may collect limited non-personal, anonymized data such as usage statistics or crash reports. These include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> — used to analyze general app usage trends anonymously.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong> — used to identify app crashes and improve stability.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These services do not collect any personally identifiable information beyond what is needed for app functionality, and we do not use them for profiling or advertising purposes.</p>

  <h2>Advertising</h2>
  <p>The App <strong>does not display third-party advertisements</strong> and does not include any advertising systems that target children or users in general.</p>

  <h2>Device Permissions</h2>
  <p>The App may request access to the device's <strong>camera</strong> to allow users to take photos within the app. All photos are stored locally on the user’s device and are not transmitted or shared externally.</p>
  <p>The App does <strong>not request access</strong> to the device’s microphone or location services.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect any non-personal and authentication data used by the App and its integrated services. We take children’s data protection seriously and limit access to only what is necessary for app functionality.</p>

  <h2>Parental Rights</h2>
  <p>Parents and legal guardians have the right to contact us with any questions or concerns regarding their child’s use of the App or our privacy practices. Upon request, we will delete any information we may have unintentionally collected.</p>
